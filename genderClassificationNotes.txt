Predict (non-binary) gender from language use on Twitter
	-pick our language use feature (or combination of features):
		*words (unigrams)
			-use of certain abbreviations/acronyms/text speak
		*combination of words (bigrams)
		*hashtags
		*topics (set of unigrams in tweet?)
		*POS
		*word class (content vs. function)
		*style words (?, from Ugheoke thesis)

	-other features not necessarily related to language use (from Ugheoke thesis):
		*tweet rate
		*avg number messages per day
		*number retweets per day
		*numer of replies
		*etc.

	-sample size? (how many users?; how many tweets per user?)

	-creating dataset
		*identify twitter users who have declared gender identity in bio
			-what are gender identity “categories” we are targeting?
			-look for things like “i’m a mom/ i’m a dad”
			*think about biases this might introduce (i.e., those who choose to disclose this information may be expressing their gender identity in different ways than this who do no disclose this information despite identifying in similar ways)
